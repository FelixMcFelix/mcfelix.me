It's strange, I think, how a sense of nostalgia for one (virtual) world, or one point in time, arises from where we least expect it.
A visual aesthetic, the feel of a specific piece of music, an outlook on the world and one's place in its community.
More and more, my thoughts have been drawn by these flashes towards the time I spent in Vana'diel---not a world I thrived in, but one that has nevertheless shaped me in no small way.

I was barely a teenager when I'd made my first forays into the world of [Final Fantasy XI](http://www.finalfantasyxi.com/).
Spellbound by the promise of a living world so far beyond what I'd come to know through the likes of Runescape, I'd bought the game some time prior at a cheap price with no knowledge of the subscription fee.
The free trial was inaccessible without binding a credit card to the account, and I was cut-up at the time.
And so the box sat, and collected dust.
At least, that was the case until my discovery of PaySafeCard *et al.*, alongside my repurchase of the game for the Xbox 360.
Armed thusly, my brother and I made our first steps into the verdant, homely town of Windurst, for those 30 days at least.
The tale spun there was not one of triumph.
In control of a brave young Tarutaru red mage named Chuefue, I never made it past level 13 despite my best solo efforts, or even our group efforts.

The central philopsophy of Vana'diel was, for the longest time, that players could not succeed on their own.
This suffused every design decision the game was built upon: the world was expansive and difficult to traverse, with real-time transport like ferries featuring heavily (alongside paid teleports offered by higher-level white mages); monsters at your own level became more and more lethal as you progressed, and death would punish players by costing experience and levels.
I'd not seen much more than the town of Windurst, having taken the lengthy and dangerous journey to Bastok only once (often anxiously waiting for monsters to pass by, or takig pains to evade them).
It took perhaps dozens of attempts to escape from the starting town, to venture forth, to see the world, and to find some of the famed grinding spots.
Death came readily, but that just made each successful trip feel all the more worthwhile.
The towns felt all the more welcoming for it; a respite from a world uncaring and in many ways unrelenting, a feeling most likely reinforced by the sheer amount of time I spent just *being* there.
They felt perhaps a little more alive and a little more homely than what most MMOs today seem to offer.
It was years before I realised why the world had been built that way.

The world of Vana'diel today is, sadly, not the one I left.

What could other worlds learn?
