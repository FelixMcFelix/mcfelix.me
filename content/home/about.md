I'm **Kyle Simpson** [Orcid Link](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8068-9909), a Postdoctoral Research Assistant and final-year PhD student in Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, supervised by [Professor Dimitrios Pezaros](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/dimitriospezaros/).
I work in the [Glasgow Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/) on the intersection of programmable dataplane hardware and data-driven networking.

I take interest in research of *network programmability*, *reinforcement learning*, *computer graphics* and *combinatorial search*, and enjoy hobbyist *game development* and [*cooking*](/recipe).

I love solving hard problems in new fields---feel free to [email me](mailto:kyleandrew.simpson@gmail.com) at any time.
