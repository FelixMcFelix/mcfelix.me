I'm **Kyle Simpson** [Orcid Link](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8068-9909), a Software Engineer at the [Oxide Computer Company](https://oxide.computer).
I completed my PhD in the University of Glasgow's [Netlab](https://twitter.com/netlab_uofg)/[Systems Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/) on the intersection of programmable dataplane hardware and data-driven networking.
Unabashed rustacean, Emotion Engine advocate, and lover of weird hardware!

I take interest in research of *network programmability*, *reinforcement learning*, *computer graphics* and *combinatorial search*, and enjoy hobbyist *game development* and [*cooking*](/recipe).

I love solving hard problems in new fields---feel free to [email me](mailto:kyleandrew.simpson@gmail.com) at any time.
