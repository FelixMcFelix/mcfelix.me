An investigation into graph models within computer vision---the project provides a criticism of existing general techniques reliant upon the *Delaunay triangulation*.
I also propose and investigate techniques for modelling and recognition of characters, against several well-known handwritten datasets as well as a sampling of fonts.

The attached [paper](/docs/sip-for-cv.pdf) constitutes my Masters dissertation.
