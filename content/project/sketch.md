The end result of a team project, Sketch is a simple Swift-inspired programming language for drawing graphics and animations.
Sketch is implemented as a JavaScript library, and is powered by an easy-to-use WebGL backend.

Unfortunately, no documentation for the language's current version is available---the implementation differs largely from the original design documents, although most language operations are shown in the test example.
