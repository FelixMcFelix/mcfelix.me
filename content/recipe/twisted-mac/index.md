# Ingredients
(To serve 3). 30 mins-ish, including vegetable and chicken prep.

* 1 chicken breast (\~250g),
* \~250ml milk,
* \~25g unsalted butter,
* \~2 tbsp. plain flour,
* 300g pasta,
* Ample cheese, grated (mainly base cheese like Cheddar, with some flavour cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino),
* 1 bell pepper (of your choosing),
* Sea salt, black pepper,
* Olive oil,
* Paprika,
* Chilli/red pepper flakes,
* Cayenne pepper.

# Instructions

## Chicken etc.
* Salt chicken breast 24 hours before, refrigerate and cover.
* Thinly slice chicken breast. Season with black pepper.
* Dice (1cm) pepper.
* Add olive oil to pan, heat till shimmering.
* Add chicken, fry and turn until all pieces change colour.
* Add diced pepper, toss, and add a generous portion of paprika, chilli flakes and cayenne pepper.
* Fry.

## Pasta
* Generously salt a potful of water, bring to the boil.
* Add pasta, simmer till al dente. Drain, saving some of the pasta water for later.

## Sauce
* Heat milk in saucepan (not to boiling or burning).
* Roux -- melt butter in separate saucepan, add flour and and stir continuously for a few minutes.
* When roux sufficiently done, add and mix in milk by small doses. Stir over medium-high heat until thickened.
* Add some reserved pasta water, add cheese. Stir. This should greatly thicken the sauce. If in doubt, grate more.

## Serving
* Add chicken and diced pepper from frying pan, fold into sauce.
* Taste, season with sea salt and black pepper as needed.
* Add pasta, fold into sauce. Serve.

# Rating?
4/5, easy and quick to make. Tastes close enough to my memory of the dish for something I came up with on a whim, which is a bonus.
